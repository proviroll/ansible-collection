This role is to spin up a Lotus Fauntain (Faucet) as a docker container. 


## Dependencies
- Docker needs to be installed
- A Lotus full node is needed for RPC calls and data directory, you can find the role [here](https://github.com/ChainSafe/ansible-collection/tree/main/roles/lotus_fullnode_docker_role)
- You need reCaptcha keys, check references below.


## How to use the role from the collection?

    ```
2.  Call the both roles from the collection in the playbook as below.
    ```yaml
    ---
    - name: Deploy lotus fullnode
      hosts: lotus_faucet
      gather_facts: false
      become: true
      roles:
        - role: chainsafe.general.lotus_fullnode_docker_role

    - name: Deploy lotus fountain 
      hosts: lotus_faucet
      gather_facts: false
      become: true
      roles:
        - role: chainsafe.general.lotus_fountain_docker_role

    #### Link to [default values](./defaults/main.yml)
3. The Lotus Fauntain will run on `0.0.0.0:7777` port and you can `curl` it.
    ```sh
    curl localhost:7777
    ```

## How to setup a wallet
1. Make sure that Lotus Fountain and Fullnode sharing the same data directory for `keystore`, by default it is is `/var/lib/lotus`
2. Get into Lotus Fountain container and generate a wallet address and take a  note of `public key`
    ```sh
    docker exec -it lotus-fountain bash
    lotus wallet new
    ```
    you can check the wallet addresses are populated in `/var/lib/lotus/keystore`
    or alternatively list the wallets as below.
    ```
    lotus wallet list
    ```
3. Export the private key of a wallet and save it in a secure place so you can import it if `keystore` dir is destroyed or you are moving service to another machine. 
    ```
     lotus wallet export < wallet pub key > pv.key
    ```
4. Import a wallet 
    ```
    lotus wallet import pv.key
    ```
